# ⚡ Bill Management System using Next.js & MySQL

This is a **Bill Management System** that allows users to manage and track **electricity bills** for renters. I built this project to solve a personal issue—my parents were manually calculating and managing renter bills every month, which was time-consuming and error-prone.

With this system, users can **easily add renters, record their electricity readings, and generate monthly bills**, all from a clean and responsive web interface.
